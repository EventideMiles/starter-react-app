# Starter React App

This project was primarily created because create-react-app was giving me high-risk vulnerabilities and I proceeded to learn how to set up a react app from scratch. I also gave it storybook and styled-components support. I hope it will be useful to anyone who wants to use it as the basis for their project.

## Features

- Build script optimized for windows powershell
